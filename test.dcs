// Example on how a DiscordScript code can look

login ".env":TOKEN // import key "TOKEN" from file ".env"

on login: // Calls when bot is logged in
  print "Logged in" // prints "Logged in" in console

on message(m): // `m` is the incoming message
  send `Hello ${m.author}` in m.channel

    // Is the same as:

on message{channel, author as friend}: // `friend` is the author of the incoming message
  send `Hello ${friend}` in channel
